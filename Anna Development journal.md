## Research
For this game I researched into door mechanics so the player can access certain areas of the scene without reaching the ending too quickly. I used the videos below to help aid with this video, it was simplistic and easy enough to follow however it didnt fully exsplain in depth all the mechanics this means i still struggled with combining what i learnt in the videos togerther to create a refined system.

For the end credits i reffered back to a video ive alredy used and added more parts to the end credits sceane i used the basic animation logic the video provided to add fade ins and more moving mechanics to further enhance the players exsperiance. this video i found was very helpful for someonme looking to find out how to eate an end credits scean as it was easy to exspand on and ehance to our gameplay.



when thinging of ways to enhance the overall player exsperiance

### What was the process of completing the task? What influenced your decision making?

### Fog
<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/dx1fflpa/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Towards the end of this project, I looked for ways to enhance the overall player experience. At the start of the game, the player would see a white void, which felt unpolished and broke immersion. To fix this, I added a fog feature that surrounds the playerâ€™s spawn area. This not only improved the visual experience but also served as an optimization technique. Without the fog, we would have had to duplicate the original world, which we wanted to avoid for performance reasons. The fog effectively hides the void and enhances immersion.

To achieve this, I enabled xponential Height Fog and created a custom material that generated **volumetric fog**, producing a dense fog wall. I then used this fog to surround the lower sections of the world, enclosing the area and masking the visible void completely.



## Outcome



## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

### What would you do differently next time?
Next time I would take on more workload and be more assertive when programming the game. I feel I could have done more in depth programming and tried more new systems out to push myself more.
